ActsAsAccurateFloat
===================

This plugin enables you to avoid rounding errors in your SQL select statements when selecting with
conditions on a float column.

For example, if you have a row with column_a equal to 3.8, find_by_column_a(3.8) will return 0 results.
This plugin will fix that.

acts_as_accurate_float works by overriding the default find statement to round off the stored
float values before comparing them to your input values so that slight rounding errors don't
mess up your results.

find_by_column_a(3.8) will now produce the following SQL:

SELECT * FROM `table_name` WHERE (round(column_a*100)/100 = 3.8) LIMIT 1;

It should work with all various find statements that include a condition on your
acts_as_accurate_float field.

Usage
===================

# specify a float column and level of accuracy you need
# accuracy is specified in number of decimal places

acts_as_accurate_float :column_a, 2


Compatibility
===================
I have only verified these float issues with MySQL, and also have only tested this plugin for use
with MySQL. If someone wants to take a crack at other databases, please let me know.
